# library

This is a personal library tool in browser made as part of the open source web development course [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com).  This is the first assignment of the Intermediate Javascript section. It demonstrates new skills learned of use of prototypes and prototypal chaining in constructing objects, and later will demonstrate skills in ~local/online storage once the API section of the course is covered~ (local storage now added).

Find the live preview [here](https://kaglet.github.io/library/).

At full screen the tool should look like this:
